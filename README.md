## About

This project now supports the **MXW01 thermal printer** via Bluetooth LE.

The MXW01 is a portable thermal printer that communicates using Bluetooth Low
Energy with the service UUID `0000ae30-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`.

Originally a Sister Project of
[Cat-Printer](https://github.com/NaitLee/Cat-Printer), this fork has been
adapted specifically for the MXW01 printer protocol.
